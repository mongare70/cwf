# CyWeather Weather Forecast

> A coding challenge to portray my practical skills given a real-world problem.

#1 Problem definition

## How?

The end user simply adds the latitude and longitude for a given place and get the weather forecast for that day at that location (6am to 6pm).

This application uses the [Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en) to fetch
the hourly temp, wind, cloud cover, and relative humidity levels.
